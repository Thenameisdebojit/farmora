## Prerequisites

### Start the Backend Server
```powershell
cd "D:\smart crop advisory prototype\backend"
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ… MongoDB connected: ac-d9lhyi0-shard-00-01.tmfmwxn.mongodb.net
ðŸ“Š Database: smart-crop-advisory
ðŸŒ± Starting database seeding...
âœ… Database seeding completed
ðŸš€ Server running on port 5000
```

### Start the Frontend Server
```powershell
cd "D:\smart crop advisory prototype\frontend"
npx vite --port 3001
```

**Expected Output:**
```
VITE v5.4.20  ready in 369 ms
âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:3001/
```

## Feature Testing

### 1. Authentication System Testing

#### Test User Registration
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/register`
2. Fill out the registration form with:
   - **Name**: Test User
   - **Email**: testuser@example.com
   - **Password**: testpassword123
   - **Role**: Farmer
3. Click "Register"

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… User should be successfully registered
- âœ… Automatically logged in after registration
- âœ… Redirected to dashboard
- âœ… User data stored in MongoDB database

#### Test User Login
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/login`
2. Use the credentials:
   - **Email**: testuser@example.com
   - **Password**: testpassword123
3. Click "Sign In"

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Successfully logged in
- âœ… JWT token stored in localStorage
- âœ… User redirected to dashboard
- âœ… Session info appears in bottom-right corner (dev mode)

### 2. Enhanced Weather Dashboard Testing

#### Test Weather Feature
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/weather`
2. Allow location access when prompted

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Spectacular animated weather hero section displays
- âœ… Dynamic weather gradient based on conditions
- âœ… Current temperature and weather info loads
- âœ… 7-day forecast cards with hover animations
- âœ… Weather details with glassmorphism effects
- âœ… Farming advisory section with recommendations
- âœ… Air quality and additional stats
- âœ… Smooth animations throughout the interface

**Fallback Testing:**
- If location access is denied, should default to Delhi coordinates
- If weather API fails, should show mock data with proper error handling

### 3. Market Intelligence Testing

#### Test Market Feature
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/market`
2. Use the commodity and location filters

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Enhanced Market Intelligence interface loads
- âœ… Commodity selection dropdown works
- âœ… State and district filters function
- âœ… Market price cards display with animations
- âœ… Price trend charts render properly
- âœ… 7-day AI price predictions show
- âœ… Price alerts system displays
- âœ… Market statistics and quick actions work
- âœ… Related commodities section functional

**Fallback Testing:**
- If backend API calls fail, should display generated mock data
- No "Application Error" should appear
- All sections should load with placeholder data

### 4. Session Management Testing

#### Test Session Features
1. Log in to the application
2. Check the session info badge (bottom-right corner in dev mode)

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Session info shows user details, expiry time, and last activity
- âœ… Activity tracking works (moves mouse, type, scroll)
- âœ… Session automatically refreshes before expiry
- âœ… Session warning modal appears 5 minutes before expiry (you can modify timeout for testing)

#### Test Session Expiry (Advanced)
To test session expiry quickly:
1. Modify the `WARNING_THRESHOLD` in `SessionManager.jsx` to `30000` (30 seconds)
2. Log in and wait 30 seconds
3. Session warning modal should appear
4. Test both "Extend Session" and "Logout" buttons

### 5. End-to-End Navigation Testing

#### Test All Features Work Together
1. Start from login page
2. Navigate through all sections: Dashboard â†’ Weather â†’ Market â†’ etc.
3. Verify all features load without errors

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Navigation between all sections works smoothly
- âœ… Authentication state persists across page navigation
- âœ… No console errors in browser DevTools
- âœ… All animations and UI components render properly
- âœ… Responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Performance Testing

### Check Browser Performance
1. Open Chrome DevTools â†’ Performance tab
2. Record performance while navigating between pages
3. Check for:
   - âœ… Smooth 60fps animations
   - âœ… No memory leaks
   - âœ… Fast page load times (<2 seconds)
   - âœ… Efficient component re-renders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Authentication Not Working
- Check if backend server is running on port 5000
- Verify MongoDB connection in backend logs
- Check browser Network tab for 401/500 errors

#### Weather Data Not Loading
- Verify OpenWeatherMap API key in environment variables
- Check if geolocation is enabled in browser
- Should fallback to mock data if API fails

#### Market Feature Shows Errors
- Check backend market routes are responding
- Verify API base URL includes `/v1` path
- Should display fallback data even if backend fails

#### Session Management Issues
- Check JWT token format in localStorage
- Verify token expiry times are reasonable
- Test with Network tab offline to simulate connectivity issues

## Success Criteria

The system is working correctly if:
- âœ… Users can register and login successfully
- âœ… Weather dashboard displays beautifully with real/fallback data
- âœ… Market intelligence loads without application errors
- âœ… Session management handles expiry gracefully
- âœ… All features work together seamlessly
- âœ… No console errors or broken functionality
- âœ… Responsive design works across devices
- âœ… Performance is smooth with good animations

## Additional Notes
