# 🎯 Quick Auth Page Testing Guide

## 🚀 Issue Fixed!

The login/register page was immediately redirecting to dashboard because users were already authenticated. I've fixed this by:

✅ **Removed automatic redirect** on page load  
✅ **Added "Already Logged In" section** with options  
✅ **Added logout functionality** to test different auth methods  
✅ **Added dev helper** to clear auth data for testing

## 🧪 How to Test the Auth Page

### **Method 1: Using the Dev Helper (Easiest)**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth`
2. Scroll to bottom and click **"🧹 Clear Auth Data (Dev)"** button
3. Page will reload and show the beautiful auth interface!

### **Method 2: Browser Console**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth`
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Paste and run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('farmora_token');
localStorage.removeItem('farmora_user');
localStorage.removeItem('farmora_refresh_token');
location.reload();
```

### **Method 3: Using the "Logout" Button**
1. If you see "Welcome back" message on auth page
